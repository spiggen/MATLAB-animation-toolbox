<h2>animation()</h2>

animation() returns an animation-object, which is a task scheduled
to be performed when it's fed into the animate-routine. The animation
contains a function which is the thing that is actually going to be performed
for each frame of the animation-sequence. You can then feed
input-arguments into this function, these input-arguments
will be fed in for each time they take on a value between from_cell to
to_cell. The syntax for this is the following:

```MATLAB:Code
my_fun = @(argument1, argument2) plot(argument1, argument2);

my_anim = animation(@(args)my_fun(args{1},   args{2}), ...        % the function to be performed during animation
                                  {0:0.1:10, sin(0:0.1:10)}, ...  % field-values corresponding to argument1 and argument2, initial values 
                                  {0:0.2:20, cos(0:0.2:20)});     % field-values corresponding to argument1 and argument2, end values

animate({my_anim})                                                % animation routine takes in a list of animations to be performed in parallel

```
The animation-routine is then going to interpolate between the initial
argument-values and the end argument-values to get a smooth animation
sequence.


<h2>animate()</h2>
animate() is a routine takes in a list of animations to be rendered, and
renders them on top of each-other for each frame, allowing you to write 
an animation with ony 3 lines or less worth of code.
Example:

```MATLAB:Code
my_fun = @(argument1, argument2) plot(argument1, argument2);

my_anim = animation(@(args)my_fun(args{1},   args{2}), ...        % the function to be performed during animation
                                  {0:0.1:10, sin(0:0.1:10)}, ...  % field-values corresponding to argument1 and argument2, initial values 
                                  {0:0.2:20, cos(0:0.2:20)});     % field-values corresponding to argument1 and argument2, end values

animate({my_anim})                                                % animation routine takes in a list of animations to be performed in parallel
```

The animation-routine is then going to interpolate between the initial
argument-values and the end argument-values to get a smooth animation
sequence.

It is also possible to change the keyframes of the animate-routine by
feeding it a list of keyframes you want to render, for example:

```MATLAB:Code
animate({my_anim}, 0:100);        % Renders the animation for each time the keyframe-number is 0,1,2,3...,100.

animate({my_anim}, 0:2:100);      % Renders the animation for each time the keyframe-number is 0,2,4,6...,100. 
                                  % Will go twice as fast as the first one
animate({my_anim}, 0:0.2:100);    % Renders the animation for each time the keyframe-number is 0,0.2,...,100.  
                                  % Will go 1/5 as fast as the first one
animate({my_anim}, [0,50,3,0.2]); % Renders the animation for each time the keyframe-number is 0,50,3,0.2.  
                                  % The routine uses the keyframes to know where to evaluate the interpolation, 
                                  % so this animation will appear choppy, but you could if you wanted to for some reason.

```

<h2>save_animation()</h2>


save_animation() is a utility to create an animation-object which, when put
into the animation-routine, saves the animation to a file.
Example:

```MATLAB:Code
my_axes = axes();

my_fun = @(argument1, argument2) plot(my_axes, argument1, argument2);

[saver, videoObj] = save_animation(my_axes, "sine2cosine_video.mp4")

my_anim = animation(@(args)my_fun(args{1},   args{2}), ...        % the function to be performed during animation
                                  {0:0.1:10, sin(0:0.1:10)}, ...  % field-values corresponding to argument1 and argument2, initial values 
                                  {0:0.2:20, cos(0:0.2:20)});     % field-values corresponding to argument1 and argument2, end values

animate({my_anim, saver})                                         % animation routine takes in a list of animations to be performed in parallel

close(videoObj)

```

<h2>n_characters()</h2>

n_characters() takes in a list of strings, where each string represents one
row of text, and a double n (that will be rounded to nearest integer).
The out_array will then contain the first n'th characters.
